    </h2>
    <p>
      Use LockThat to keep track of your team's shared resources and who is using them. No more pesky messages like "Is anyone using the test site?", just run <kbd>/lockthat lock test-site</kbd> and you'll either get to use the test site or you'll get to know who is using it. Run <kbd>/lockthat help</kbd> to learn more about the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: LockThat does not prevent multiple people from using the same resource. It works on an honor system!
    </p>
